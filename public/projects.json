I joined Vox Media’s Brand Design team as their Brand Design Intern this summer, and was given the opportunity to tackle this challenge.</p><p>After several weeks of extensive research, including a competitive analysis and an audit, I finalized a style guide and template system that strengthened brand recognition, established artwork consistency across 8 unique brands, and streamlined the process of producing podcast assets.</p><p>More on my process coming soon; stay tuned. 🎧</p>",

This approach sets the app apart from its competitors by providing users a more fun, personalized stretching experience.</p><p>To encourage users to actually perform the stretches provided by the app, we decided to include a social feature. Once a user is done setting up a routine, they could share their settings with their friends or coworkers so that they all receive the same notifications.
